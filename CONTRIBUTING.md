# Contribute to the Online Chess Game Project

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Online Chess Game project! Below is a guide to help you understand the current issues and how you can improve the application.

---

## Project Overview
This is an online chess platform built using React, Ethereum, and Web3.js. Players can connect their wallets, make payments in ETH, and start chess games. However, there are some issues and areas for improvement.

---

## Current Issues
### 1. **Chess Game Does Not Load**
   - **Location**: `src/components/OnlineMode.jsx`
   - **Description**: After connecting the wallet and making a payment, the chess game fails to load, resulting in a white screen.
   - **Potential Cause**: Missing state initialization or render logic for the chessboard component.

   **Error Preview**:

   ```error
   socketService.ts:21 WebSocket connection to 'ws://localhost:3001/socket.io/?address=0xbf786287609d1e4bfa96794893fc899ae957f484&username=Player&EIO=4&transport=websocket' failed: WebSocket is closed before the connection is established.

   socketService.ts:39 Socket connected successfully
   socketService.ts:47 Game created with ID: 3gik7tpb
   ```

### 2. **Alerts Instead of Popups**
   - **Location**: Multiple files, primarily `src/components/OnlineMode.jsx`
   - **Description**: The application currently uses `alert()` for notifications, which is disruptive and not user-friendly.
   - **Improvement**: Replace `alert()` with a modal-based popup component for better UX.

---

### 3. **Missing Loaders**
   - **Location**: `src/components/OnlineMode.jsx`
   - **Description**: There is no indication of ongoing processes such as connecting to the wallet, making a payment, or loading the game.
   - **Improvement**: Add loaders to show progress for the following actions:
     - Wallet connection
     - Payment processing
     - Chess game initialization

---

### 4. **Add Input Validation**
   - **Location**: `src/components/OnlineMode.jsx`
   - **Description**: The input fields (e.g., stake amount) do not have proper validation, leading to potential errors or misuse.
   - **Improvement**: Add validations to ensure:
     - Stake amounts are positive integers.
     - All required fields are filled before proceeding.

---

### 5. **Suggested Features**
   - **Enhance User Interface**: Improve the layout and aesthetics of the chess game and wallet integration screens.
   - **Add Sound Effects**: Provide sound feedback for actions like moves, payments, and connection success.
   - **Game History**: Display a log of moves made during the chess game.
   - **Dynamic Theme**: Allow users to switch between light and dark themes.

## How to Contribute
1. **Fork the Repository**  
   Clone the project to your local machine.

2. **Set Up the Development Environment**  
   Follow the instructions in the `README.md` file to set up your environment.

3. **Fix or Enhance the Code**  
   - For **Chess Game Loading Issue**:
     - Investigate the chessboard component's state and props to ensure they are initialized correctly.
     - Verify that all dependencies (e.g., chessboard library) are properly imported and loaded.

   - For **Replacing Alerts**:
     - Use a library like `react-modal` or `Material-UI` for implementing popups.
     - Ensure consistent design and UX throughout the application.

   - For **Loaders**:
     - Add a spinner or progress bar using CSS or a library like `react-loader-spinner`.

   - For **Input Validation**:
     - Implement checks for valid input in the `handleSubmit` or `onChange` functions of relevant components.

4. **Submit a Pull Request**  
   - Include a detailed description of your changes.
   - Reference the issue(s) you are addressing.
